# Docker-compose examples and "How to" collection
Hello everyone, you found my small but growing collection of open source Projects.

Every directory has an example docker-compose file which you can use for your homelab.

A link for the documentation can be found inside the directorys README.
The documentation covers the concept and what you need to install and configure.
